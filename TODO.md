**User Authentication:** Implement user registration, login, and logout functionality. This will involve creating user models, handling password hashing (using libraries like bcrypt), and managing user sessions (using JSON Web Tokens or JWT).

**User Profiles:** Every user should have a basic profile where they can see their own published recipes and saved recipes. This is a simple way to give users a sense of ownership over their content.

**Recipe Creation and Management:** The main feature of your app is allowing users to create and share recipes.

    Create: A form for users to input recipe details. The form should include fields for a recipe title, description, ingredients, and instructions.

    Read: Users can view individual recipe pages. These pages will display all the details entered during the creation process.

    Update: The recipe creator can edit their own recipes if they made a mistake or want to make changes.

    Delete: The recipe creator can remove their own recipes from the platform.

# Social Features

These features introduce the "social" aspect to your platform, allowing users to interact with content and each other.

   1.  **Recipe Feed:** A central page that displays all the recipes published by all users. This is the main feed where users will discover new content. The feed should show the recipe's title, a brief description, and the author's name.

   2.  **"Save" Functionality:** Users should be able to "save" or "bookmark" recipes they like. This adds a layer of personalization and allows users to easily find their favorite recipes later. You can create a simple model to track which user has saved which recipe.

# Technical Features

These features are crucial for building a stable and functional MERN application.

1. **Database Schema:** Design a clear and efficient database schema. You'll need at least three main models:

    - User: To store user information (e.g., username, email, password).

    - Recipe: To store all the recipe details (title, description, ingredients, instructions, and a reference to the user who created it).

    - SavedRecipe: To link users to the recipes they have saved. This is a many-to-many relationship.

2. **RESTful API:** Build a RESTful API using Node.js and Express.js. This API will handle all the requests from your front end for creating, reading, updating, and deleting data.

3. **Front-End:** Develop the front-end using React. The React application will consume the API you built to display data and handle user interactions. Use React Router for navigation between different pages (e.g., the home feed, user profile, and individual recipe pages).
